# Fantasy_Football_Draft_Widget
This contains my code for constructing a Fantasy Football draft assistance algorithm using Gaussian Kernel Density Estimation (Gaussian KDE). "DAsHA" stands for Draft Assitance Heuristic Algorithm. All the coding is done in Jupyter notebooks, and the data is pulled from public sources and is included as .csv or .xlsx files in the repository.

The first notebook, "2020 Fantasy Football DAsHA data prep," cleans and merges the fantasy football projections (which were pulled 8/21/2020) and generates the KDE for each player. KDEs center a normal Gaussian distribution over each input point, then sum all of those functions to generate a non-parametric probability density function. Here is an example from the data:

This distribution is then used to generate median point estimations and confidence intervals for each player. For example, the distribution above generates:

The second notebook, "2020 Fantasy Football DAsHA user interface," provides a user interface that can be used during a fantasy football draft to optomize draft choices.

**Update:** For the 2021 draft, use the "2021_ffl_df.csv" sheet in conjunction with the DAsHA user interface notebook.

The DAsHA "user interface" will return a panel of players at each position with the highest projected points. DAsHA will also show a "marginal" score, which is how many more points this player is expected to generate compared to the best player at the same position who is most likely to be available in the next round. 

For example, if the top RB available now is projected to get 150 points, but the top RB that will be available during your next pick is projected to get 100 points, the marginal score will be 50. However, if the top kicker available this round will also be available next round, the marginal score for drafting that kicker will be 0. In general, you should draft the player with the highest marginal score. DAsHA will also return a chart of confidence intervals of each player in the panel generated above. This lets you select based on variance as well as projected points.

Finally, DAsHa generates graphs comparing the players at the two positions with the highest point projections to the next best option available at that position in the current round. This again is so that you can make an informed decision based on the variance / distribution of point projections in addition to the raw point totals. For example, the tails on either side show upside / downside potential. Depending on your draft position, you may be willing to accept a player with a lower median projection but higher upside as opposed to locking in a player with a higher median point projection, but very low variance.

An example of DAsHA's menu output is:
